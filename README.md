# Gondi
## A Go Network Device Abstraction Library

### Gondi is meant to abstract away the differences in communicating with various network devices.
This library is intended to allow for a primary program to send configurations and updates to various network devices,
without having to worry about the differences in communication.


## This is currently not being worked on. It is here in case it can help someone else to solve some of the same issues. If you'd like to take this code and run with it, by all means have at it!
